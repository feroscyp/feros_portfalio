      <description>The goal of this problem was to predict the polarity of tweets, categorizing them as positive or negative. The original dataset had a column with various sentiments, which were recoded following certain instructions, without considering those classified as neutral. This posed a challenge when deciding what to do with the neutral tweets, as randomly recoding them seemed like an inaccurate option.
To address this obstacle, a Naive Bayes model was proposed to be trained only with positive and negative tweets, and then used to predict the polarity of neutral tweets.</description>
